# Make Me A Cake
Little project I came up with for selecting options for a cake.

## Description:
I was making a cheatsheat for forms with the different types of inputs and it all ended up being about cake so I decided to turn it into an actual cake making mini project. Which in turn turned out to be a not so mini project, and a website with multiple pages (I am now very aware of why things like react exist), which has been the biggest project that I have made. I'm overall so happy with it
