# Make Me A Cake
A little project I came up with for selecting options for a cake, that turned into a four page website. 

## Description:
I was making a cheatsheat for forms with the different types of inputs and it all ended up being about cake so I decided to turn it into an actual cake making mini project. Which in turn turned out to be a not so mini project, and a website with multiple pages (I am now very aware of why things like react exist), which has been the biggest project that I have made. I'm overall so happy with it

## Future Development:
I may play around with this project more in the future maybe change things around. I was also thinking of using a framework like react and using that to completley redo the entire thing and make it on a bigger scale, with adding a backend to it as well.

## Technologies:
HTML, CSS, Pure.css, Google Fonts

## Usage:
Everything was picked and designed by me!
Open it up in the github link, and play around with it!

## Difficulties / Changes I would make:
Something that I found was difficult was things that were repetative, like the header and footer, logo etc.
And I definitly see how things like React are so helpful for when you want to make a change, you don't have to go through everything once again. I would use that next time that I am to build anything that is bigger than 2 pages. 

## Successes:
I do think that the css stylesheets were organized pretty well, if I could make one change I totally forgot to do the font size in the root and would do that next time to make it a bit more consistent across the pages. I love how the colours looked and the fonts, the organization of it all, and getting the pictures put in and organized.
